# Extended Makefile template

This is an extended template showcases the use of configuration options and their usage in the source code. The source code example uses OpenMP parallelisation as well as LIKWID instrumentation as an example.

The example is extracted from [The Bandwidth Benchmark](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/TheBandwidthBenchmark) project.
