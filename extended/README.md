# Extended Makefile template

This is an extended template showcasing Makefile configuration options and their usage in source code. The source code example uses OpenMP parallelisation as well as LIKWID instrumentation as an example.

The example is extracted from [The Bandwidth Benchmark](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/TheBandwidthBenchmark) project.
